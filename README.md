# Ionic 3 HttpClient Rest Crud Examples (GET, POST , UPDATE, DELETE)

This is a simple Crud Ionic 3 application. The application goal is to use the json-server to simulate a rest backend application.

I though so cool the json-server, then I'm resolved to create a application to consume the rest service in json-server

Never more wait by backend developer to create a rest application for you test your frontend application.
  
## Run Fake Rest API server 

    npm install -g json-server
    json-server --watch db.json 

## Run Development server

Run `ionic lab` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8100/ionic-lab`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
